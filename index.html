                    Regular bios are all the same so I'll talk a little about how I ended up here. Quite a long time ago I went to art school and became a graphic designer for a startup digital printing agency in Gainesville, Florida. After a while, my childhood interest in computers had resurfaced, so I enrolled in a bachelor's of science program at USF majoring in IT (which I now consider "CS lite"). To earn my degree I had to do quite a bit of programming in C, C++, Java, and shell. All of the coding done was to solve abstract puzzles, build basic data structures, implement famous basic algorithms, script up a few cron jobs, and other kinds of college busywork. I never made any usable software, never collaborated on a team, and barely used any source control. Which was quite fun. But it wasn't Software Engineering by any stretch. The closest thing was a final project in shell which kept me busy for a while but really just made a poor Unbuntu server work really hard for almost no real reason at all.

                        Before graduating, I was working as a desktop IT system administrator and continued to do so afterwards for a couple of years. Once in a while I had a chance to whip up a simple script to make my job a little easier. My current job has me working with a lot of SQL scripting. But life as a sysadmin is not the easiest or most rewarding for my personal interests. I wanted to code again, but for real this time.

                        Since graphic design has been something I have a bit of experience with, I felt web development would be a field where my experience in IT would harmonize into a very cool and interesting career. So far, I'm having tons of fun! It's addictive, the hours fly by as I chew on one code problem at a time, and sometimes I forget to let the dog out to pee.

                        Maybe after I've got a great front-end engineering job the dog and I can walk on time again.
